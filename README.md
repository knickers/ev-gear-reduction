# Vehicle Gearing

Calculate vehicle drivetrain properties, such as gear reduction and top speed, based on variables like wheel diameter and motor RPM.

##[demo](http://robot54.com/gearing/).

## Calculate the Wheel Diameter
This unit is given in inches, and is the outer diameter of the tire.

If you wish to find a wheel diameter to match a vehicle gear reduction, motor RPM and desired top speed.

## Calculate the Gear Reduction ratio
This unit is given as *reduction* / 1. For example *9.3 / 1* and *12 / 1* have *9.3* and *12* for the values entered here.

This will calculate the needed gear reduction for a vehicle with known tire size, given motor RPM and vehicle speed.

Electric motors often have a specified max RPM and continuous RPM, try out both values, and match those with the desired top speed and cruising speed, to find a good gear reduction balance.

## Calculate the Motor RPM
This unit is Revolutions Per Minute (RPM)

This will calculate the motor's rotational speed for the given vehicle's wheel diameter, gear reduction and desired speed.

Electric motors often have a specified max RPM and continuous RPM, try out different speed and gearing values to fit in the motor's power curve.

## Calculate the Speed
This unit is in Miles Per Hour (MPH)

This will calculate the vehicle's speed for the selected wheel diameter, gear reduction and motor RPM.

Electric motors often have a specified max RPM and continuous RPM, try out both values to see top speed and cruising speed respectively.
